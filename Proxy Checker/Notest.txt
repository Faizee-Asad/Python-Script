What is Proxy? 

A proxy is like a middleman between your device and the internet. When you use a proxy, your internet requests go through it first, hiding your real identity (like your IP address) and sometimes adding extra privacy or security.

Here’s the difference between HTTP Proxy, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 in simple terms:

HTTP Proxy:

Works only for HTTP/HTTPS traffic (web browsing).
Good for tasks like web scraping or accessing blocked websites.
It doesn’t support all types of data, only web-related protocols.

SOCKS4 Proxy:

Supports non-HTTP traffic (e.g., FTP, email, torrents).
Basic, doesn’t have authentication or encryption.

SOCKS5 Proxy:

Advanced version of SOCKS4.
Supports more protocols and types of traffic.
Offers authentication (username/password) and better handling of UDP traffic, useful for gaming, video streaming, or VoIP.
In short, SOCKS5 is more versatile and secure, while HTTP proxies are specific to web traffic.
